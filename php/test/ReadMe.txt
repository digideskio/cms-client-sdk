PHPUnit Test Scripts for Volar Video CMS API
Kevin Overall 2013

These scripts are intended to be run using phpunit.phar
(http://phpunit.de/manual/3.8/en/index.html)

Run using "$ php phpunit.phar SCRIPT.php"

Scripts
ConnectionTest.php - Tests ability to connect to the CMS through multiple
	calls.

Thorough...Test.php -  Not Recommended to run. Runs through every possible 
	combination of valid, invalid, and missing parameters. These tests 
	only check for success, failure, and empty results. Upon failure, 
	test case is indicated by a ternary code.
	0 - Parameter not sent
	1 - Invalid parameter sent (negative #, garbage string, etc.)
	2 - Valid parameter sent
	Test cases consist of short list of these numbers, with each number
	indicating a parameter. These should correspond to the order the
	parameters are listed in the wiki. If not, check the original script
	source. (Check the switch statement in the paramDemux() function)

Individual...Test.php - Similar to Thorough...Tests, these scripts run through
	each parameter individually with valid and invalid cases, with all others 
	left blank. Each test is indicated by the index of the parameter and the 
	same code as used in thorough tests. These should generally be used if available 	as the corresponding Thorough Tests can take from 15 minutes to many hours.

Adv...Test.php - These tests handle more specific cases than the other
	scripts. They will usually check if the correct data types are returned, 
	are in the correct order, and any search functionalities are working.

Edit...Test.php - Attempts to create, edit, and delete objects through the
	API, validating their success. There will be a DELETE boolean var,
	indicating whether or not the script should attempt to delete any
	objects it generates at the end of the test.

	IMPORTANT - Make sure that the POSTER_PATH variable is equal to the 
	absolute path to the image file stored in the test folder

CleanAPITest.php - Deletes all test objects generated by Edit Tests. Should
	always be run after an Edit Test fails or is run with the DELETE var
	set to false, to prevent the CMS from being clogged up with test
	objects.
