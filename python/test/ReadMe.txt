Python unittest Test Scripts for Volar Video CMS API
Kevin Overall 2013

Ensure that the Requests python module is installed
http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/

Run using "$ python SCRIPT.py"

Scripts
TestConnectionSuccess.py - Tests ability to connect to the CMS through multiple
	calls.

TestConnectionFailure.py - Tests results of invalid connections

TestThorough....py - Runs through each parameter, passing each one an empty, 
	invalid, or valid case. These tests only check for success, failure, and 
	empty results. Upon failure, test case is indicated by a ternary code,
	along with the index of the parameter
	0 - Parameter not sent
	1 - Invalid parameter sent (negative #, garbage string, etc.)
	2 - Valid parameter sent
	Test cases consist of short list of these numbers, with each number
	indicating a parameter. These should correspond to the order the
	parameters are listed in the wiki. If not, check the original script
	source. (Check the switch statement in the paramDemux() function)

TestAdv....py - These tests handle more specific cases than the other
	scripts. They will usually check if the correct data types are returned, 
	are in the correct order, and any search functionalities are working.

TestEdit....py - Attempts to create, edit, and delete objects through the
	API, validating their success.

	IMPORTANT - Make sure that the filepath in the test_ImageUpload method is
	set to the absolute path of the image file stored in the test folder

CleanAPITest.py - Deletes all test objects generated by a TestEdit....py script. Should
	always be run after an Edit Test fails or is run with the DELETE var
	set to false, to prevent the CMS from being clogged up with test
	objects.
